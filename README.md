# Project Descriptions


#### <a id="P1"></a> Project 1: Serial Print on Set Interval
---
Print out an incremented variable on a set interval using serial print to the serial port of the Arduino as human-readable ASCII text. 

---
#### <a id="P2"></a> Blink on-board LED on Set Interval
---
Utilizing the on board LED of the Arduino, blink the LED on a set interval.

---
#### <a id="P3"></a> Project 3: Button Press Detection
---
Through the use of the Raspberry Pi and a seperate breadboard, we will detect when the push button has been pressed and print this out to console.

---
#### <a id="P4"></a> Project 4: Button Press to Blink LED
---
On an Ardunio, we will detect the press of a button on a seperate breadboard, store the button state and blink the LED when the button state is 'ON' and stop blinking the LED when the button state is 'OFF'.

---
#### <a id="P5"></a> Project 5: Ultrasonic Sensor Movement Detection
---
Attaching a (part number) ultrasonic sensor to a breadboard and wiring it to our Raspberry Pi, we will be able to detect when an object blocks or moves in front of the sensor.

---
#### <a id="P6"></a> Project 6: Photovoltaic Cell Light Detection
---
Utilizing a (part number) Photovoltaic Cell, we will be able to detect light changes and their intesnity on a seperate breadboard and print these out to console.

---
#### <a id="P7"></a> Project 7: Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Determination 
---
Utilizing a (part number, different from 5) ultrasonic sensor, determine the relative distance of an object in front of the sensor.

---
#### <a id="P8"></a>  Project 8: LED Brightness Control with a Potentiometer
---
Detect the level of desired power level desired by the user by reading the resistance applied on a poteniometer and turning on 1, 2 or all 3 attached LEDs on a breadboard.

---
#### <a id="P9"></a> Project 9: Multiplexed Display Hello World
---
Through the connection of a (pending part number) multiplex display, we will print out hello world onto the attached display through the use of an Arudino.

---
#### <a id="P10"></a> Project 10: DC Motor Control
---
Control the speed of an attached DC motor by pressing a push button, with the speed being dictated by the state you put the motor in via the amount of button presses.

---
#### <a id="P11"></a> Project 11: Multiplexed Display Count Down
---
With a (pending part number) multiplex display, we will count down from 10 to 1 and then display a custom message on the display with our Ardunio.

---
#### <a id="P12"></a> Project 12: Tic Tac Toe
---
Play Tic Tac Toe on your through your serial port against an 'AI' and display the current state of the game on a breadboard through RBG LEDs.
